## OOP-hell-shooter
Little bullet hell game suddenly appeared while learning OOP.

Inspiration goes out to Bob Ross incarnated as a [train whistle operator](https://github.com/CodingTrain), especially his fireworks challenge.
Without it I couldn't have figured out how to make those amazing explosions.

There's a small bug I couldn' figure out, check the issues page, if you know something about javascript.

Play the game [here](https://fraasi.github.io/)
