## OOP-hell-shooter
Little bullet hell game suddenly appeared while learning OOP.

Inspiration goes out to Bob Ross incarnated as a [train whistle operator](https://github.com/CodingTrain), especially his fireworks challenge.
Without it I couldn't have figured out how to make those amazing explosions.

There's a small bug, in which the game freezes, that I couldn' figure out. Check the issues page if you know something about javascript. If not, just press space to start a new game and write a letter to your congress representative.

Play the game [here](https://fraasi.github.io/)

Left and right arrow keys to move, up arrow to shoot and space to start a new game.
